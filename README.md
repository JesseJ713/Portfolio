## Description

The goal of this project is to create a Portfolio that can be used over the course of the time spent learning at UT and beyond.
The Portfolio will exemplify a homepage, contact page, and a project page.
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap will be utilized in the first main iteration.

### Project Status

Initial commit is adding structure files and repo directory. Within those structure files are the templates to prepare content to be entered. Mindset is that of prepping the portfolio for 7/23/2020's class for any more insight and then working in more detail over the weekend.

Added a form to the contact page in order for users to reach out with the intended use of receiving a response from my personal email address. Functionality is not quite there, but with future lessons I'll revisit and add functionality. Template is set up and accessible.

Portfolio page is now included with placeholder images that include links and alt text. Accessibility works as well with images stacking in a clean vertical line as screen becomes smaller.

Included folders for more organization within the files. Repathed all existing pathways and tested all for success. Files look much cleaner!

Finishing up first stages of requirements by filling in some HTML semantics where necessary.

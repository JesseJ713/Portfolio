# Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a Portfolio that can be used over the course of the time spent at learning at UT and beyond.
The Portfolio will exemplify a homepage, contact page, and a project page.
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap will be utilized in the first main iteration.

### Project Status

Initial commit is adding structure files and repo directory. Within those structure files are the templates to prepare content to be entered. Mindset is that of prepping the portfolio for 7/23/2020's class for any more insight and then working in more detail over the weekend.
